We are Team 5.

Members of our team are Kim Ga-eun, Kim Chan-woo, Kim Tae-wan, and Park Gun-woo, who belong to the Department of Computer Science at Chungbuk National University.

The project is to implement 'Yutnori', a traditional Korean game, as a program using C language.

Through this program, you can enjoy yutnori without needing yuts, a game board, or game pieces.

If you have a better opinion on the program, please actively give it to us.

Thank you!
